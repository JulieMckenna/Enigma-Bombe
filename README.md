# Enigma-Bombe
Creating an Enigma Machine and Bombe Machine

Will be using Python and creating a user interface for people to encrypt and decrypt messages as they would like.

We will use databases to keep track of daily settings for the enigma. We will also use a database for the bombe, and will help keep track of combonations that had been tried and failed.

Enigma:
Required Parts - a plugboard(allows up to 10 letters to be swapped), 3 rotors(offset the alphabet), a reflector(the final step)
User input: Date of message(can be used to auto fill the variables from a database), 10 letter swaps, the 3 rotors(I - V), the reflector (A or B), and the message.

will show the encryption method
will show the decryption method - same as the encryption

Database:
Will keep track of the engima settings for that day. The user can input the day in the user input - and the program can autofill the settings for that day. 
There are fields for the 10 plugboard switches
The 3 rotord
The refelctor




Bombe:

So we're going with Hello World for now

This is more complex and will be based on the Enigma machine.
Will we keep a pharse at the end of each message so it will be eaiser to decrypt.
Test pharse: "Hello World"
